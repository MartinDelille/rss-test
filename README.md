# Liberation.fr Author RSS Feed Generator

## Summary

**Answer to your question:** Liberation.fr does **NOT** provide official RSS feeds by author. However, I've created a custom solution that scrapes Benjamin Delille's author page and generates an RSS feed for you.

## What I found:

1. **No official author RSS feeds**: Liberation.fr only provides general RSS feeds by topic/section (available at https://www.liberation.fr/liste-flux-rss/)
2. **No standard RSS patterns**: Common author RSS URL patterns (like `/auteur/benjamin-delille/rss/`) return 404 errors
3. **Custom solution works**: I successfully created a script that scrapes Benjamin Delille's articles and generates a custom RSS feed

## Files in this project:

- `check_liberation_rss.py` - Script that tests common RSS URL patterns for authors
- `generate_author_rss_v2.py` - Main script that scrapes articles and generates RSS feed
- `benjamin_delille_rss.xml` - Generated RSS feed for Benjamin Delille

## How to use:

### 1. Run the RSS generator
```bash
python3 generate_author_rss_v2.py
```

This will:
- Scrape Benjamin Delille's author page
- Extract his latest articles 
- Generate a valid RSS XML file (`benjamin_delille_rss.xml`)

### 2. Use the RSS feed

You can use the generated RSS file with:
- **RSS readers** (Feedly, Inoreader, etc.) - Upload the XML file or serve it from a web server
- **News aggregators** - Import the XML file
- **Automation tools** (Zapier, IFTTT) - Use the file URL to trigger actions

### 3. Automation options

To keep the RSS feed updated, you could:

1. **Run the script regularly** (daily/weekly) using cron:
   ```bash
   # Add to crontab to run daily at 9 AM
   0 9 * * * cd /path/to/script && python3 generate_author_rss_v2.py
   ```

2. **Serve from a web server** - Upload the XML file to a web server and update it regularly

3. **Use GitHub Actions** - Set up automated RSS generation in a GitHub repository

## Example RSS output:

The generated RSS feed includes:
- Feed title: "Articles by Benjamin Delille - Liberation.fr"
- Latest articles with titles and links
- Valid RSS 2.0 format compatible with all RSS readers

## Alternative solutions:

1. **Web monitoring services**: Use services like Visualping or ChangeDetection.io to monitor the author page
2. **IFTTT/Zapier**: Create workflows that monitor the author page for new content
3. **RSS services**: Some third-party services can create RSS feeds from any webpage

## Requirements:

- Python 3.x
- beautifulsoup4 (`pip3 install beautifulsoup4`)
- requests (`pip3 install requests`)

## Note:

This is a web scraping solution, so it may need updates if Liberation.fr changes their website structure. The script includes error handling and multiple parsing strategies to be robust against minor changes.
